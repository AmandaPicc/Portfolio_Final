      <p>Two Wins to Win is a two-player cooperative/competition board-based card game, where players figure out how to utilize negotiation strategies to achieve their interest-based priorities while maximizing their scores. The caveat being, both players must have positive scores in order for any of the players to be declared a winner. The players act out scenarios as a recruiter and recruit, trying negotiate the strongest offer while maintaining a win-win situation.   </p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>In the early stages of brainstorming, we found ourselves wondering if we could develop a game that would help our peers (and even ourselves), to <b style="color:#4CA19C;"> more confidently navigate the complex and often intimidating process of job interviews and offer negotiation</b>. As we mapped the process from interview to accepting an offer, we suspected that the offer negotiation especially possessed a unique opportunity for learning. Then upon reading that 84% of Gen Z workers aged 18-24 and 74% of Millennial workers aged 25-34 accepted the first salary they were offered our interest became concrete. Finally, in conversations with peers, many of whom fell directly into our target audience, our suspicions confirmed that there was a level of discomfort when it came to negotiating job benefits. 
<br/><br/>

          Upon establishing our subject area, we were eager to identify problem areas that our target audience may experience in the negotiation process from which we could use as a basis to derive our learning objectives. (Seen below in Job and Negotiation Map)

  <!--Research and insights-->
  <div class="row" data-aos="fade-up">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <h2>Research and insights</h2>
        <p>We found in the early stages of researching how the skill of negotiation was being taught, particularly to students learning interest-based negotiation skills, that <b style="color:#4CA19C;">it was often exercises rather than fully gamified situations </b>that were being utilized. Additionally, these exercises were very clearly meant for use in educational settings and often with companion curriculum and/or instructor facilitation. 
          <br/><br/>
          <b style="color:#4CA19C;"> On the other end of the spectrum, existing games that we did find aiming to teach the player about negotiation avoided focusing on the specific setting of a job offer. </b> A major concern we had with this route was the reduced potential transfer for that setting.  We also believed that taking it too far out of the professional setting created potential for our players to see negotiation as a battle, where you try to get what you want purely at the experience of the other player, which would be a detriment when negotiating in a professional setting. Therefore, we felt that there was a place to bridge these two extremes and create a game which takes an innovative approach on negotiation.
          </p> <br/><br/>

      <h2> Learning Objectives</h2>
      <p>Through research, in-class critiques, and the iterative design process, we ultimately landed on the following four learning objectives that would capture what players would be able to do after playing Two Wins to Win. 
      </p>
      <p><b style="color:#4CA19C;">LO1: </b> Identify concepts associated with the practice of negotiation and the role they play, for example: logrolling, anchoring effect, and BATNA.</p>
      <p><b style="color:#4CA19C;">LO2: </b> Identify negotiable benefits commonly included in a job offer including: salary, signing bonuses, PTO, work location, work hours, gym membership, moving reimbursements, pet care, daycare, childcare, and more. </p>
      <p><b style="color:#4CA19C;">LO3: </b> Identify and implement negotiation strategies such as Interest-Based Negotiation, Logrolling, and Generate Option Strategy.</p>
      <p><b style="color:#4CA19C;">LO4: </b> Role-play as a human resources professional (recruiter) to better understand the role of the company representative in the negotiation process.</p>

 <!--Experience Goals-->
 <div class="row" data-aos="fade-up">
  <div class="col-sm-12">
    <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
    <p>We also developed a series of experience goals which allowed us to remain consistent with our desired voice, tone, and experience that players would encounter within our game. </p>
      <p><b style="color:#4CA19C;">EG1: Semi-competitive:</b> Negotiation is all about working together with your counterpart and creating a win-win situation. Therefore, we would like to create a game where both players care about each other, not just aiming to win at the expense of another. Ultimately, we want them to be thinking about how to achieve both their own interests and the interests of the other player.
      <p><b style="color:#4CA19C;">EG2: Cooperation & Problem Solving </b> By the end of the game, players should reach a resolution where they agree on the final deal, meaning that the process of the game guides them towards that resolution.</p>
      <p><b style="color:#4CA19C;">EG3: Roleplay & Experimentation: </b>In real life, people get anxious about salary negotiation. While simulating that anxiety in the game would make it feel more real, we would rather give the player an environment to freely experiment with negotiation strategies without the real-world consequences for failure. Therefore, we have designed this game so people who don't have experience in salary negotiation, e.g. college students, could have an opportunity to experience and familiarize themselves with the salary negotiation process within a fictional setting. We emphasized this goal by providing the persona cards (recruit and recruiter) to both players.</p>
      <p><b style="color:#4CA19C;">EG4: Humor: </b>Building off of the previous experience goal, much of the peer feedback mentioned that one of the most fun and interesting parts of playing a role-playing game is humor. We introduced humor into the roleplay aspect of our game so people could enjoy the game with comfort.
        </p>
      <p><b style="color:#4CA19C;">EG5: Progressive Information Disclosure (and Non-Disclosure): </b> Another important aspect of negotiation is trying to understand the underlying interests of the other side. In the beginning of the game, both players keep hidden information from the other player, such as their top priority, and work towards achieving their interests while uncovering the hidden information from the other player to attempt to ensure a win-win agreement.

    <h2>Playtesting and iterations</h2>
    <p>We conducted playtests with a group of friends and acquaintances who fall into our target audience of individuals who are or will be searching for employment and are likely to find themselves in the position to negotiate a job offer. This included the in-class playtesting. 
<br><br>
      During playtesting, we introduced the players to the mechanics of the game and gave them their roles. We asked them to think-aloud as they played through our game. Afterwards, we asked questions such as: What was the most interesting aspect of the game, What was the most frustrating part?
      
      We integrated their feedback into our revised learning goals, experience goals, and prototypes. 
      </p>
     <b style="color:#4CA19C;">Key Takeaways</b>
      <ul>
        <li>The role-play aspect was most interesting for players</li>
        <li>Negotiation Tips need to be better integrated into the gameplay</li>
        <li>Players found it difficult to start negotiation</li>
        <li>Scoring mechanics needed to be further developed</li>

    <h2>Final Game</h2>
        <p> After rounds of playtesting, critiques, and game iterations, we integrated what we had learned into our final game design.
        </br></br>
          Below is a list of links that provide access to the final game (via playingcards.io), game instruction manual, and other game assets (persona cards and cards).
        <br/><br/>
        There were limitations provided by the platform we were using to prototype the game in a remote setting. However, one fantastic feature we played with included automation.  Playingcards.io requires players to manually move and draw cards, however with the help of the automation feature we have incorporated a reset button at the top left corner of the board that resets all the cards back into their home decks.
