      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>As we neared the end of a tumultuous 2020, we also found ourselves wrapping up a semester full of ambiguity, technological challenges, and remote classrooms. We had spent nearly a year in a pandemic-driven world and it was no surprise that our final project would exist in self-chosen domains irrevocably changed by the year’s events: animal adoption/fostering, grocery shopping, store deliveries and finally electronic health records. 
<br><br>
      Fortunately for one borderline-obsessive dog mom of a 120lb Rhodesian Ridgeback (ok.. that’s me), a group of like-minded individuals found themselves in the same Zoom breakout room that was affectionately labeled “C-Team 5 (Paul).”
      <b style="font-weight: 550; color: #6247AA;">Driven by our own love for animals and our desire to make the world a better place </b>(even hypothetically), we chose to move forward with our project in this pandemic-driven domain: “purchasing, adopting, or fostering a pet”. 
      <br><br>
      It wasn’t long before images of empty animal shelters and stories of exponentially rising adoption application numbers began infiltrating our media. They served as a small beacon of optimism in a time where good news was so desperately needed. However, even with the tens of thousands of individuals stepping up to offer support to the ever-growing population of shelter animals, there are still thousands of animals without a home.
      <br><br>
      Logistically, we were tasked with building a <b style="font-weight: 550; color: #6247AA;">mobile-first, responsive web solution </b>to be showcased on two different screens sizes. We conducted research, studied design patterns, wireframed, prototyped, and presented a virtual pitch to a ficticious animal rescue as a team of five, while scattered throughout the country.

<!--Research and insights-->
<div class="row" data-aos="fade-up">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <h2>Research and insights</h2>
      <p>In a remote environment, our team utilized a <b style="font-weight: 550; color: #6247AA;">pop-up user research approach where we relied on directed storytelling</b> to learn about users’ experiences. Following the same interview protocol, we would each conduct a minimum of three interviews over the course of five days. Interviewee’s were recruited via Reddit, in addition to personal contacts who had recently adopted and/or fostered a pet. Our motivation was to understand the process our target users go through in order to adopt/foster an animal as well as identify pain points associated with the process. 
        <br><br>
        Following our initial interviews, we organized our data in individual <b style="font-weight: 550; color: #6247AA;">customer journey maps</b>, discussed our findings, and further grouped the data into a larger <b style="font-weight: 550; color: #6247AA;">affinity diagram</b>. (+1 for Miro!). By viewing the data in this manner of organization, we were able to identify commonalities in the adoption/fostering process that would serve as the basis for our comprehensive “General Customer Journey”. 
        <br><br>
        <b style="font-weight: 550; color: #6247AA;">We found that while websites consistently served as the primary touch point for potential adoption/foster applicants, communication and the application process itself was found to be scattered and disorganized.</b> The process was described as ‘informal’ and ‘lacking transparency’, often leading to feelings of confusion and frustration. This sentiment was echoed so frequently that we felt drawn to focusing on the application process for our solution, as seen in the “Area of Focus' Customer Journey Map.

<!--Iterations and prototypes-->

    <h2>Design iterations and prototypes</h2>
<p>After identifying the scope of our design, we individually sketched low-fidelity prototypes which we would combine into a single collaborative design. Each round of design that would follow on our path through low-, mid, and ultimately high-fidelity prototypes would be accompanied by <b>Wizard of Oz and Think-Aloud testing</b>. In doing this, we were able to incorporate the feedback we received into each respective iteration of our design.</p>    <br>

  <div class="col-sm-6" data-aos="fade-up">
    <h4>User-testing takeaways</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Be clear and concise</b> with your language. In the early stages of our design, user-testing participants struggled to understand the goal of multiple informational pieces because they found the language vague and unclear. This wasn’t a huge concern because of the fidelity level, but an area of focus in solidifying our high-fidelity prototype.</li>
      <li><b> Affordances over minimalism. </b> Our initial design utilized a very minimalistic approach, that while looking nice, left users wondering where to click and what their next steps would be. We increased the affordance of our design and saw positive feedback in our user-testing as a result. </li>
      <li><b>Transparency is key! </b> The goal of our design was to increase transparency within the application process. Taking the veil off the application process and providing the applicants with information explaining every step of the way received a lot of positive feedback. 
      </ul>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-6" data-aos="fade-up">
  <h2 style="padding-top: 20%;">Visual design</h2>
  <p>The motivation behind our visual design choices centered around two main ideas. First, we wanted to create an <b> inviting, playful aesthetic </b> that would welcome users of all ages and demographic backgrounds to our site while simultaneously <b>demonstrating a clear hierarchy of content </b> with color and typography. 
  <br><br></nr>Second, <b>we wanted color to increase the clarity and usability of our site</b>. Our primary color, purple (#6247AA) was used in top-level headings as well as for buttons that were a “call to action” for the user. Our goal was to be consistent in this color usage throughout the entire website, making it easier for our users to identify.
